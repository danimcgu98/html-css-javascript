          What happens when you send an email or a message on facebook, instagram or any social media platform you use?
          How do you know that the person you send the message to is the other one that can read it? In today's society 
          data is constantly being sent back and forth between users and it is important that this data is protected in some 
          way. So how is this done? Simply put our data is encrypted and once it is recieved by the user it is decrypted?
          The process of this encryption and decryption that happens all the time falls in the field of cryptography. That being
          a puzzle per say, one made using very complicated mathematical algorithms that make a simple message such as <q>hi</q>
          look something like this: 67otkRjevhdexWDFZKslcg==. Now how does the other person that recieves this encrypted message
          decrypt this message? Well, the system does that for us! Each sender and reciever both have a public and private key 
          associated with where they are sending it from. The data is encrypted with the reciever's public key (think of this as
          the email address you put in the <q>to:</q> box when you are picking the recipients. Under the hood this is specifying
          a public key by which to encrypt the data with. After this when the user recieves the message the system attempts to decode
          the message with their own private key (this is similar to a password you shouldn't share) thereby only allowing the recipient
          the data is meant for to translate this data to be readable. Without this public and private key system of encrypting and
          decrypting data any messages we send to our peers could easily be read by anyone and no one would have any privacy!

          Have you ever wondered why experts will always say to change your password every six monthes? Well, data breaches happen
          quite often and people's information is spilled onto the web for anyone's taking all the time! A lot of these data breaches
          are shared on the dark web where nefarious individuals can gain access to your accounts and potentially cause trouble for you.
          You can go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a> and see for yourself if your data was involved in a 
          breach before and if so you better change your password. While we can't exactly stop these data breaches from happening there
          are things you can do to make your password nearly impossible for a threat actor to discover with the current technology. First
          off you should set up multifactor authentication also commonly called 2FA or two-factor authentication. With this system in place
          not only would someone have to know your password but they would have to have access to your second source to log in. However, when
          setting up this try to avoid setting up 2FA via phone number as SIM swapping by means of social engineering is fairly easy to do.
          Next, you would want to set up a very strong password. One in which would take years for a hacker to get to. To do this make sure
          the password has at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one symbol and one number and make sure the password is as 
          long as possible. If you would like to see how secure a password is you can visit <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank">

          comparison to help you visualize it.
